# Gene-based association test of interactions for maternal-fetal genotypes

The gene-based association test of interactions for maternal-fetal genotypes (GATI-MFG) is developed to test the joint effect of maternal and fetal genes on disease risk while allowing for maternal-fetal genotype interaction.

The proposed method has several advantages:

* It may account for the complex relationships between maternal and fetal genes during the embryogenesis. 
* It is a gene-based test that can integrate the collective effect of multiple genetic variants, including both common and rare variants. 
* It is especially suited for detecting the joint effects due to rare variants with a larger sample, which may be missed by the conventional single-variant-based association tests.
